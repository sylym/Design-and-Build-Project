**Status:**

Post-training datasets, the obtained model falls short of the desired accuracy standards.

---

**Conclusions:**

To enhance the model performance, the following measures have been identified:

1. **Adjust Confidence Levels:**
   - Change the confidence levels and select the optimal configuration.

2. **Augment Dataset Size:**
   - Increase the volume of datasets to enhance model learning.

3. **Image Realism Enhancement:**
   - Adjust selected images to closely resemble those captured by the car, improving real-world applicability.

4. **Epoch Adjustment:**
   - Increase the number of epochs and select the best-performing configuration.
