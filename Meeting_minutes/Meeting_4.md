**Meeting Purpose:**
The meeting aimed to conduct on-site testing of the robot car's functionalities and assess the connectivity between the three components. Several challenges were encountered, including parameter adjustments for the robot car's operation in different mazes, multiple iterations for modifying turning angles and speeds, and addressing recognition issues in the image recognition program. Additionally, logic errors in the webpage during the process of drawing the robot car's route were identified and resolved through on-site adjustments.

**Key Points:**

1. **Parameter Adjustments for Robot Car Operation:**
  
   - **Challenges:** Parameters for the robot car's operation needed constant adjustments based on the roughness of maze surfaces.
   
   - **Resolutions:** Iterative modifications were made to turning angles and speeds to adapt to various maze conditions.
