**Agenda Item 1: Integration of Image Recognition Algorithm and Route Drawing for Robot Cars**

**Status:** Currently, the IoT team's image recognition algorithm provides two interfaces for robot cars: (1) local image recognition (via local file paths), and (2) local camera image recognition (using the computer's camera). The robot cars in the telecom team need real-time access to the image recognition algorithm, as the efficiency of local image recognition is insufficient.

**Conclusions:** A new interface is needed to achieve near real-time image recognition.

**Responsible Person:** Qian Liyang

**Deadline:** October 8th, 2023

**Agenda Item 2: Testing the Interface for Robot Cars to Access Image Recognition Algorithms**

**Status:** The robot cars in the telecom team currently experience significant delays when accessing the image recognition algorithm. There are also issues with the angle and clarity of the camera module.

**Conclusions:** Improvement is needed for the Wi-Fi communication module and camera module.

**Responsible Persons:** Huang Jingyu, Liu Yiming, Xing Zheng

**Agenda Item 3: Drawing Routes Based on the Robot Car's Movement Trajectory on the Web Interface**

**Status:** The web interface developed by the e-com team cannot achieve real-time route map drawing. Further refinement of the code logic is required.

**Conclusions:** Modification of the route map drawing code is necessary.

**Responsible Persons:** Zhao Yinjie, Chen Xi
