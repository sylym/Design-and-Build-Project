**Agenda Item 1: Introduction of Functions and Principles of IoT Team's Image Recognition Algorithm**

**Status:** The image recognition algorithm is trained based on the Yolov8 model and PyTorch. It can recognize three types of objects: book, cube, key. Currently, the algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy in identifying objects and generates automatically annotated images after recognition.

**Conclusions:** The accuracy of the algorithm needs improvement. Continued training is necessary to identify a more robust model.
