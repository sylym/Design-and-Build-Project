# Design and Build Project

## Introduction

This project is a robot control system. The purpose of this system is to utilize an automatic robot to explore a walled maze and discover a hidden treasure within it. Additionally, the robot will utilize a camera to capture images of the treasure and employ an object detection algorithm to identify the type of treasure.

The system includes a web interface for monitoring the status of the exploration. Through this interface, users can access information such as the maze map, captured images, and exploration time. Furthermore, we will develop a web or mobile application that provides current and historical exploration records.

To support the operation of the entire system, a database will be designed to manage all relevant information. This database will handle storage and retrieval of map data, image data, and exploration records, ensuring efficient system performance and data reliability.
